              learning organization that teaches students the skills they need
              to transition into a technology-focused career. We have been
              partnering with organizations like yours since 2018 to deliver
              software and design solutions within an educational setting.
              Projects like yours are the final part of a 12-week boot camp
              curriculum and serve as the crowning achievement for student
              groups who are graduating from our program. We call this
              opportunity our student capstone project.

              Capstone Project Overview Student teams work with real clients,
              such as yourself, to create either functioning software or user
              experience design assets that they present in a public
              demonstration. The student teams take projects from ideation to a
              functioning state over four to eight weeks, depending on the
              program. As a project sponsor, you would collaborate with a
              dedicated team of creators, and be free to use the source code or
              design assets after the project concludes.
