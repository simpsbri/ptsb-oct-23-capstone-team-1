        What is a Capstone? Front Range Community College and Upright is a
        learning organization that teaches students the skills they need to
        transition into a technology-focused career. We have been partnering
        with organizations like yours since 2018 to deliver software and design
        solutions within an educational setting. Projects like yours are the
        final part of a 12-week boot camp curriculum and serve as the crowning
        achievement for student groups who are graduating from our program. We
        call this opportunity our student capstone project.{" "}

        Capstone Project Overview Student teams work with real clients, such as
        yourself, to create either functioning software or user experience
        design assets that they present in a public demonstration. The student
        teams take projects from ideation to a functioning state over four to
        eight weeks, depending on the program. As a project sponsor, you would
        collaborate with a dedicated team of creators, and be free to use the
        source code or design assets after the project concludes.
