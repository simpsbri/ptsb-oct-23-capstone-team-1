          team of software development or user experience design students from
          Front Range Community College can work together with you to build a
          prototype, proof of concept, design map, or minimum viable product to
          solve your needs.

          What is a Capstone? Front Range Community College and Upright is a
          learning organization that teaches students the skills they need to
          transition into a technology-focused career. We have been partnering
          with organizations like yours since 2018 to deliver software and
          design solutions within an educational setting. Projects like yours
          are the final part of a 12-week boot camp curriculum and serve as the
          crowning achievement for student groups who are graduating from our
          program. We call this opportunity our student capstone project.{' '}

          Capstone Project Overview Student teams work with real clients, such
          as yourself, to create either functioning software or user experience
          design assets that they present in a public demonstration. The student
          teams take projects from ideation to a functioning state over four to
          eight weeks, depending on the program. As a project sponsor, you would
          collaborate with a dedicated team of creators, and be free to use the
          source code or design assets after the project concludes.
